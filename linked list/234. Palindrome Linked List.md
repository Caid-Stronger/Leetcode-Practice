Python Code
```
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        dummy_head = ListNode(0, head)
        fast = dummy_head 
        slow = dummy_head 

        while fast and fast.next: 
            fast = fast.next.next 
            slow = slow.next 

        slow = slow.next 
        previous= None 

        while slow: 
            temporary = slow.next 
            slow.next = previous 
            previous = slow
            slow = temporary 
             
        while previous: 
            if head.val != previous.val: 
                return False 
            head = head.next 
            previous = previous.next 

        return True

`快指针`速度为2， `慢指针`速度为1  <br> 
当`快指针`到最后一个数字，`慢指针`在middle的前一个 <br>
然后`慢指针`从中间开始将head 的`后半部分`进行翻转 <br> 
`后半部分`反转后和`前半部分`逐个比较value <br> 


- The `fast` pointer moves at speed 2, and the `slow` pointer moves at speed 1.  
- When the `fast` pointer reaches the last node, the `slow` pointer is right before the middle.  
- Then the `slow` pointer starts reversing the second half of the linked list from the midpoint.  
- After reversing the second half, compare its values one by one with the first half.
