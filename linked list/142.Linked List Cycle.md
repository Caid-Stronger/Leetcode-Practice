`快指针`速度为2， `慢指针`速度为1 <br>
最终在圈内相遇：快指针走过 `x+n*(y+z)+y` ,慢指针走过 `x+y` <br>
时间相同，路程/速度，得到等式 `x = (n-1)(z+y)+z` <br>
当`n = 1` 的时候，得到`x = z` <br>
因此推导 `x = z` <br>
只需要在快慢指针相遇的时候，将慢指针放回起点，那么再次相遇的时候就是环形入口 <br>


The `fast pointer` moves at speed 2, and the `slow pointer` moves at speed 1.  
Eventually, they meet inside the cycle: the fast pointer travels `x + n*(y + z) + y`, and the slow pointer travels `x + y`.  
Since the time is the same and distance/speed, we get the equation `x = (n - 1)(z + y) + z`.  
When `n = 1`, we get `x = z`.  
Therefore, we deduce that `x = z`.  
We only need to reset the slow pointer to the starting point when the fast and slow pointers meet.  
Then, the next meeting point will be the entrance of the cycle.
