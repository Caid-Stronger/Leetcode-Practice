Python Code 
```
from operator import add,sub, mul 

def div(x, y): 
    return int(x / y ) if x * y > 0 else -(abs(x) // abs(y))


class Solution:
    op_map = {'+':add, '-':sub, "/": div, "*":mul}

    def evalRPN(self, tokens: List[str]) -> int:
        
        stack =[]
        for token in tokens: 
            if token not in {"+", "-", "*", "/"}: 
                stack.append(int(token)) 
            else: 
                op2 = stack.pop() 
                op1 = stack.pop()
                stack.append(self.op_map[token](op1, op2)) 
        return stack.pop()

The division between two integers always truncates toward zero. <br>
题目要求，因此需要自己写div 函数，python的自带函数是取最小的 <br>
如果不是操作运算符号，就压入栈内，如果是操作符号就弹出两个数值然后操作  <br>


First, a custom division function `div` is defined. This is because Python's default division behavior does not truncate toward zero <br>
when handling negative numbers, but the problem requires truncation toward zero, so a custom function is needed.<br>
Next, an operator mapping dictionary op_map is created, which binds the operator symbols (like +, -, *, /) to their corresponding computation functions. <br>
Then, the program iterates through each token in the input: <br>
If the token is a number, it is converted to an integer and pushed onto the stack;<br>
If the token is an operator (e.g., +), the program pops two numbers from the stack — the first one popped is treated as the right operand, <br>
and the second as the left operand. It then applies the corresponding function to compute the result and pushes that result back onto the stack.
