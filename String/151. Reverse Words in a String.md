Python Code 
```
class Solution:
    def reverseWords(self, s: str) -> str:
        s = s[::-1] 
        s = " ".join(word[::-1] for word in s.split()) 
        return s 
        
```

`s[::-1]`  ➝  "eulb si yks eht"         <br>
`split `    ➝  ["eulb", "si", "yks", "eht"]    <br>
`reverse each` ➝  ["blue", "is", "sky", "the"]      <br>
`join`      ➝  "blue is sky the"            <br>

1. Reverse the entire string character by character
2. Split the reversed string into words
3. Reverse each individual word
4. Join the reversed words back into a sentence
